# Introduction
The Floating Isles is a text-based resource collection game that I designed for a final project in Elements of Computers and Programming (CS 303E) with the help of Berkin Kutluk. As my first Computer Science course, this project focused more on displaying the fundamentals of programming: data structures, control flow, iteration, object oriented programming, importing modules, text-based GUIs, and save files. This project serves more as a tech demo of my foundational Python knowledge than a finalized game. Lastly, this project was created at the beginning of my Computer Science journey and thus does not include some of the software development best practices learned in future CS coursework; this project should be utilized as a litmus test for my progress in CS and may be improved upon at a later date.

# Requirements
This project does not require any modules outside of the included Python3 modules.

# Installation
Make sure all files have been downloaded. No additional downloads or installations are required outside of the provided files and Python3. Run the TheFloatingIsles.py file as you normally would a Python3 file on your device. For example:
> python3 TheFloatingIsles.py
